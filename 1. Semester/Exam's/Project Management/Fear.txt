fear comes from a part of the brain called the lizard brain known as the amygdla 

one of the challenges of the brain is that it doesnt know when a challenge can be good or bad 

There are 4 common triggers
    1. Uncertainty 
    2. Attention 
    3. Change 
    4. Struggle 

Through the eyes of our lizard brain everything is black and white

Our lizard brain is very primative and therefore can make some things seem like much more of a struggle than it should be

fear is often robbing us from reaching our goals, and even if you fail at something you can still feel like you have accomplished something by doing it all together

Most people seak to destroy the lizard brain but what you can do is try to trick the lizard brain and by that make yourself better at identyfying when its actually dangerous and when you are in a learning experiance

Nobody is perfect when it comes to handling fear but you can get better at it!
