# Ohms law
## What is it?
Ohms law is used to calculate Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power in a electronic circuit so that you can use the right components and avoid circuit failure.
## Why is it used?
Its used before making most circuits so ensure that non of your components will get damaged and ensure that you have enough power for each component.

it makes it so that you wont have to test something over and over again and destroying components until you find something that works.
