RMS
    the numbers we see when messuring is normally the RMS
    the acual peak voltage will most likely me much heigher
        its important to remember to use the right one when calcualting

waveform 
    formfactor
        find out if its uniform
    chresfactor
        high would have high peak
        low would be closer to the middle

Voltage divider/potential divider
    a passive system so adds no power
    uses a voltage drop form a serice circet

You can combine sinus curves to make different once

PWM = Pulse wieth modulation 
    times something is swithched on and off
    can be used to simulate a frequinze by switching arond the ammount you are turning it on and off
