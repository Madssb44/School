Today we started learning about waveforms

We when through how to use a osoloscope
    It first of all needs to be conected to a power sorce, theres a lot of settings but a few of the important once are:
        Vertical frequency, horisantal frequency, triggerrate, mesurements
            Vertical is used for messuring how high the frequency goes usually messured in volts
            Horisantal is used to choose how many times pr Second, milisecond, nanosecond, you want to messure
            triggerrate is used to make a stabel picture of the waveform and needs to be withing the vertical range of the wave you want to messure
            mesurements are used to pick what ammount you want to messure for so depending on what you are working with volt, Kvolt, Mvolt, and so one the same goes for HZ or frequency,
            you can also change the messurements for frequency to messure something other than hz but we didnt over that yet, 

the different waveforms we are gonna work with to begine with
    We went over a few different waveforems today:
        Sinus
            Sinus waveforms are reconized by the steady flow between positive and negative with no spikes on either direction
        Squre
            Squre waveforms are reconized by them going from their negative to positive almost instantly and staying for a bit before going to the opposite again making the waveform look like squre's when looked at
        Triangle
            Triangle waveformes are reconized by the steady positive rise until it hits its peak and then the same steady fall until it reaches its peak negativity 
        Sawtooth
            We were tought about 2 different types of sawtooth waveforms a negative and a positive one, the difference being in the way they act,
                A positive sawtooth waveform will take a quick rise to its peak before slowly falling down to its negative and taking a large spike again making it look like sawtooth shape when looking at the waveform

                A negative does the same but in reverse, so a slow rise before taking a large fall down to its negative peak and going back up

                they are usually using 90% of the time during a cycle to either climb and 10% to fall or reversed depending on if its a positive or negative sawtoothwaveform 

the different tools you need to use to get it to work
    theres a few different tools you need to be able to messure the different types of waveformes

    A Ocoliscope is used to messure the waveform it self amd turn it into something we are able to watch

    A frequency generator is used to make the different waveforms and set the volt they cover

    A probe is used to messure from a output into the Ocoliscope and can be a few different things
        A probe can be a little pin you set directly onto the thing you want to messure while having another ground contact

        A cabel can be used with a frequency generator to conect it directly instead of having to use a probe and hold it on what you want to messure 

Some of the terms we used were:

    RMS = the active output of the voltage
    HZ Heartz or the frequency its going at
    vpp = Volt Peak to Peak
