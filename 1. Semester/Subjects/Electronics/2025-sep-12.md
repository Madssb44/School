# All about waveforms

## Today we started learning about waveforms
throughout the document are the following points: 

1. **Ocoliscope**
    - How to use it
    - Vertical
    - Horizontal 
    - Measurements

2. **Waveforms**
    - Sinus
    - Square
    - Triangle
    - Sawtooth
        - Positive
        - Negative 

3. **Tools**
    - Ocoliscope
    - Probe
    - Frequency generator
    - Cables 

4. **Terms commonly used**


### We when through how to use a ocoliscope
It first of all needs to be connected to a power source, theres a lot of settings but a few of the important once are:

### Vertical 
Vertical frequency, horizontal frequency, triggerrate, measurements<br>
Vertical is used for measuring how high the frequency goes usually measured in volts

### Horizontal
Horizontal is used to choose how many times pr Second, millisecond, nanosecond, you want to measure

### Triggerrate
triggerrate is used to make a stable picture of the waveform and needs to be withing the vertical range of the wave you want to measure

### Measurements  
measurements are used to pick what amount you want to measure for so depending on what you are working with volt, K volt, M volt, and so one the same goes for HZ or frequency,
<br>
you can also change the measurements for frequency to measure something other than hz but we didn't over that yet, 

## Waveforms
Theres a lot of different waveforms each having their own special properties. Working with them requires a way to sense/measure the waveform, Theres a alt of different types of sensors for the different types of signals that can exists.

### Sinus

Sinus waveforms are recognized by the steady flow between positive and negative with no spikes on either direction

### Square

Square waveforms are recognized by them going from their negative to positive almost instantly and staying for a bit before going to the opposite again making the waveform look like square's when looked at

### Triangle

Triangle waveforms are recognized by the steady positive rise until it hits its peak and then the same steady fall until it reaches its peak negativity 

### Sawtooth

We were thought about 2 different types of sawtooth waveforms a negative and a positive one, the difference being in the way they act,

- Positive sawtooth waveform will take a quick rise to its peak before slowly falling down to its negative and taking a large spike again making it look like sawtooth shape when looking at the waveform


-  Negative does the same but in reverse, so a slow rise before taking a large fall down to its negative peak and going back up


- They are usually using 90% of the time during a cycle to either climb and 10% to fall or reversed depending on if its a positive or negative sawtooth waveform 

### PWM

One of the ways we humans can reproduce waveforms normally only found in nature is with PWM also known as Pulse Width Modulation

PWM is made with a by a microchip to act as a signal using a few different things

- Duty cycle
## Tools
the different tools you need to use to get it to work

theres a few different tools you need to be able to measure the different types of waveforms

- Ocoliscope is used to measure the waveform it self amd turn it into something we are able to watch

- Frequency generator is used to make the different waveforms and set the volt they cover

- Probe is used to measure from a output into the Ocoliscope and can be a few different things probe can be a little pin you set directly onto the thing you want to measure while having another ground contact

- Cable can be used with a frequency generator to connect it directly instead of having to use a probe and hold it on what you want to measure 

### Some of the terms we used were:

RMS = the active output of the voltage

HZ = Hertz or the frequency its going at

vpp = Volt Peak to Peak
