# Different Terms to know

## RMS
RMS = Root Mean Square <br>
the numbers we see when measuring is normally the RMS, meaning the average value measured over a short period of time used to make it readable for humans and easier to understand and work with. <br>
The maximum of voltage or peak voltage will be a lot higher and the minimum being lower. <br>
This is important when calculating depending on what you will be needing the calculation for.


## Waveform
Theres a few different types of waveforms a few being: 
### Form Factor
a waveform thats uniform through out


### Cares Factor
A waveform with a higher peak and a lower being closer to the middle/lower  

## Dividers
Dividers is used in systems to have more control allowing you to create electric current, measure energy transfer and determine resistance <br>
They are passive systems and therefore provide no additional power

You can combine sinus curves to make different once

## PWM
Pulse width modulation <br>
A way for humans to control waveforms and make our own, being one of the most used since its the only one we can control and easily produce <br>
made by having a constant flow of voltage and turning it on and off at extremely high speeds to the point where motors cant sense the change making it look like a constant <br>
Then by controlling the duty cycle and speed we can creak or emulate different types of waveforms allowing for what essentially powers almost all electronics made by humans that doesn't directly react to waveforms coming form something natural such as sound, light, etc.
