resisters are 


pot resisters can provide diffrent resistances depending on how they are set

color bands 


fixed value resisters
    carbon
        up to 20% difference from the resistance given by the manucatrue
        resistance can change with change in temp in the surounding area
        most traditional and very resistant 
        carbon and cearmic
            the mix determins the resistance

         
    film/cement 
        metal film, carbon film, metal film, 
        lazer trimmed to fit a pricice resistance value
            used for most pricition circets

        metal film
            most durable
            low noice

    wirearound
        much larger and very prisice but with a low ohm value
        can carry much higher abounts of power than others
        designed to be mounted onto a heatsink to make sure they can carry more current

        used where large amounts of energy needs to be disapated to heat and sometimes even used to heat up things
        
        phace shift
            curent wave form change
            its resistance changes with the sound in the surounding area
