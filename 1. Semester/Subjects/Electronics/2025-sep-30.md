# Our own circuit

Today we talked about how to make our own circuit on a print board we were handed as part of the classes and started learning about how to solder and where the different things should be places on a board


## We are working with?

since its a raspberry pi pice we will be working with mainly there are some things that are known that we will have to keep in main when choosing the different parts to add to it and where to add them,

### Voltage

A pico has 3 power out ports/pins that we can work with:
- 3V out 
- VBus (5V)
- VSys (5V)

this important to keep in mind as to not try and power something that would require more that we are able to deliver to it!

### LED's

The first thing we will be soldering that needs power will be 6 led's
- 2 Green
- 2 Yellow
- 2 Red

Each needing their own resistance to be able to light correctly without getting too much power!

- Red = 330 Ω
    Red led's needs the highest amount of resistance out of all of them

- Green & Yellow = 220 Ω
    Green & Yellow needs a bit less resistance due to them needing a bit more volt to light up in comparison to the red led's

### The right way!

Coming out of the led are 2 anodes that needs to be soldered to the board but its not as simple as just soldering them onto the board... <br>
the 2 anodes have different properties when it comes to a circuit other than the light they glow.

The 2 anodes have different lengths to indicate which is which

Its of course always a good idea to test the components before soldering them onto a board no matter what since the standards are not always the same for everything and there can be a lot of different problems causing something not to work.
