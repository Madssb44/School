Make a protocol yourself on the tabel 


We need to run it in a simulation with the whole tabel
    send a DNS & HTTP

it starts by asking the DNS if it knows the website/HTTP you are requesting and if it does it sends back the IP address you requested

then the pc sends out a HTTP request form the web server with the now known IP address

Its a good idea to take a good look at the simulations since there is gonna be a task at the 1 semester exam about it
