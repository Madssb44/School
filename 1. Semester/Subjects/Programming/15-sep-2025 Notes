Today we will be learning about a few different things such as what prossing is, what different variables we have, what input is and how to use it and how to call back already known information

Flow chart
    Design
        problem
        psudokode
    Write the code
        Acually coding it 
    fix the syntax error
        there will almost always be errors when writing code so time to fix it
    test the code
        Test it out and see if it works
    fix the logical error
        You will almost always make mistakes when thinking about what you want a program to do so time to fix it so it works like it should

input proces and output
    Refers to you inputting something the code processing it and giving you a output to work with

psudo code
    draw, write, think it out without syntax

    A way to set up the steps your either gonna work on the code or who you want the code to flow 

Data types
    str
        Strings are text
    int
        Integers are a whole number
    float
        Floats are numbers with decimals
    list
        Lists are a way to store information together in a set and be able to call it back later
    tuple
        tuples are a locked data with information that cant be changed and can have both a number value and a string at the same time
    range
        you can set things withing a range to make it do different things depending on what you tell it to
    set

    frozenset

    bool
        tests if something is true or not

What are variabels
    Variabels are a way to store information, theres a lot of different types such as a: string, float, interger, turple just to name a few, its the way you can store different information in a program and depending on its type it works differently with different functions, 

what is processesing when used in coding
    it normally refers to the process the code goes through in the program you are writing

what is input
    input is a function you can use to store information in your code that the end user can type in themselves, it can be things such as a name, age, number or more information depending on what you require the end user to input

    The input function works by typing input()
        You can set it's type by typing what you want it to be before input and putting it in bracets such as this: str(input()) or int(input()), theres more ways to set its type but its useful when you need it for a thing later where its type might be inportant

    its stored in a variable that you set yourself such as this example: age = input()
        Here the age the end user types in will become a variable age which can be called back whenever needed,

    you can make your input have text tied to it when you show it to the end user like a print function would have by typing "" inside the brackets as shown here: input("Whats your age")this would show 'Whats your age' without using a print function to show it

    if a variable is changed at a later point it will overwrite the previouse value so its important to remember what your other variabels are called so you dont overwrite them by accident at a later point

    So by combinding all the things above you could make something like this
        age = int(input("Whats your age"))
        print("oh you're",age,"im sorry to hear that")
    here you have the end user input their age then call it back to use it in a print function later, you also saved it as a int so you would be able to change it at a later date if the program you are writing would requre age to be something that would be changeable at a later point
