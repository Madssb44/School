You are always gonna meet some resistance when trying to get to your goal, it can both be from yourself and what you think about yourself but it can also be from the people around you telling you its too hard.

You can use resistance to make yourself stronger in what you are trying to do, learn, or get to

Everything you do in life will have a effect on what happends in your life from the samll things to the big decitions you take, some of the things that happends is because of you and some are because of the people around you.

What is it to take accountability

You are the only person who can take control of your life, you are the only person who is accountable for your own life!

Make a list of things you have to do over a week
    The list will consist of 3 parts
    1 = the things you need to do
    2 = what you are doing
    3 = what you are done doing
    write it down

you are only allowed to do one thing at a time!

its a good way to gamefy your daily or weekly tasks and make it easier to get all your things done

It works really well in small projects, daily tasks,

make a list of all the weekly tasks you have to do (Use the app: trello)

The problem we will be working with is: 

Simon has a problem with making food for him and his room mate
He needs to make food 5/7 days off the week since he isnt working and the room mate is

Simon is diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and ADHD
    This makes it hard for him to get started making food if he is focused on something else around the time he needs to start cooking.
    Due to some of the medicine hes taking he doesn't feel hungry and cant use that as a reminder to make food

There isnt a specific time they eat at since his room mate is working different hours from week to week making it hard to plan out when to start cooking from week to week since the work hours of his room mate can change from day to day. 

They buy grocies together on the days where this room mate doesn't work late hours and they dont have a lot of storage space so they cant have a big supply of food at all times
