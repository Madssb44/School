Today we will be working with curiosity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

keep your curiosity its important to keep evolving throughout your life
its one of the few things that we as humans are the only beings able to do when it comes to making progress in the world

its dangerous to take children's ability to be curios

one of the things we can do to make our own curiosity better is by breaking out daily routines and trying new things and by that expanding what we might be interested in and then making our whole experience more interesting

How do we keep our curiosity
    always ask open ended questions to keep a conversation going
    keep talking about what sparks interest and ti might just lead to more things that will spark interest later

    trying new things is one of the best ways to make yourself more curious

        Have different recipes require the same ingredients for the ability to prep beforehand
    HMV find a time to eat and consider different work hours
        Set a time to eat at the latest time off work since they don't need to eat early
    HMV make sure the food doesn't get boring

ideas

A app/website with recipes, time to make, whats needed to make it all together
    it should only be recipes that are easy to follow and simple to cook

    the option to insert a time where you want to eat so it can give you a time to start cooking or a time to live after cooking it if you want to prep for more than one day

    when choosing a recipe have more options that use the same ingredients to reduce the need to shop daily to cook
