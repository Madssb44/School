# Curiosity 

## Self reflection & identification on my daily life:

While there of course is a lot of things you can reflect on i wanted to focus on one of them i have been having some problems with recently after i stopped working for the first time because of stress.
Before i got stressed and had a really rough period i had a wonderful relationship with food and cooking in general, i was always excited to try new recipes,
i often went out of my way to find and try new foods and food from other cultures in general.

But since being at home for a while during my recovery from the stress and getting diagnosed with other things such as ADHD, asperger's, GERD, and other things. 
My relationship with food have been awful since then.
Because of that i wanted to experiment with bringing back my curiosity for food, flavour and food-culture again, 

## Practical application:

To be able to apply curiosity in regards to food i knew i needed to take a few steps to make it possible for myself.

First thing i did was i started looking for new and exciting foods, this could either be on the internet
form books or something i would see walking down a street.

Second was to take notes of what looked good and interesting and looking up what would be needed for making it and where i would be able to get the things needed to make it

Third was talking about the things i saw and telling people about the foods i was finding interesting and having conversations about food in general to not only further my own want and curiosity for it but also surround
myself with people who would also be able to spark more curiosity for it.

When it then came to the application some problems came up and one of the most primary ones i was able to identify was the routine i had made for myself regarding food at this point.
I never really got started with my projects i had set myself with food, it was always the same routine i went back to.

So to circumvent this i made the chose to break completely out of my routine, the order i was doing things in and when i would do them, this caused my to have to thing more about what i was gonna do next and that allowed me to finally get started with my project

I was then able to finally go out of my way to try new things again and reignite my interest and curiosity for food.
This worked for 1 day, the very next day i was back to my routine and back to my normal eating habits which to be fair was expected, I know very well it takes a while to break down something you have been doing for a long period
and much longer to change it out with something that both takes more energy and mental power but i now knew it was possible.

For the next week i tired breaking out of my routine again to see if this was a one time thing i was able to do or not and i was able to repeat it and again try new things.
With the knowledge that its possible and how i would be able to do it its all about making it more common and letting myself wander more off in thought and excitement of new foods and experiences.

I knew the more i will practice this the more it would become something that wouldn't require as much energy and mental power to do, even after just doing it a few times i already notice a difference in how i think about food
and how i think about trying new foods, so my plan is to keep trying new things and break out of my routine so i hopefully can get to a point where i can be able to have a healthy balance between discovering new foods and making
the different foods i have discovered and love. 

## Reflection:

This whole experience and experiment has opened my eyes to how much i can affect my own curiosity and how hard easy it is to kill it as well, from doing a daily routine and never trying something new to taking each day step by step to
experience new things, and while its not a reliable way to live to never plan anything and always try new things i think its healthy to try and incorporate it into your life to keep not only life interesting but also keep your mind 
healthy and able to be excited about trying new things and seeking out new experiences.
