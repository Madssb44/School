Project on fear:

Finding something i fear or are afraid of wasn't really the problem i had but i still
had a really hard time deciding on what i wanted to try and challenge when it came to fear.

I had a few options i was picking between and decided to go with socializing, now some context might be
required to know what i mean, For the best part of my adult life i haven't really been social what so ever.
Since i got out of school i have only been working and keeping to myself, i have always had a really hard time
reaching out to people no matter what the context for why i would do so was, rather it being a friend i wanted
to spend time with or a service i needed such as a mechanic, whenever i was thinking about either writing or calling
someone i could get a heavy feeling in my chest and my head would start making up scenarios where i would be
bothering people by texting them so i could always talk myself out of doing it in the first place.

Which leads me to what i did in regards to this task, since i don't really have friends or people i talk to in general
i chose to go to a place where i not only didn't need to be physically but also a place where i wasn't know.
For a while i have been watching livestream's on twitch, a platform where people play games, watch videos or just talk with people in general
most people on there have their own community mostly on discord where people who like a creator can talk about what they are doing and just talk in general
so for the first time in all my time on twitch i joined a community on discord.

The step of joining wasn't the hard part tho the difficult part came with the whole talking there. When you join it gives a little announcement
to the server but since it is a rather big community its nothing people notice so the way in was easy, i then found the places where people were talking
and chose a specific room to talk in, the room i chose was called live-chat which is a place thats only open when the streamer is live and is meant
to be a place to talk about whats going on in the stream so i felt it was a good place to go since i didn't have to come up with new topics to talk about
and i wouldn't be barging in on someones elses conversation.

Now in theory it should be easy enough to just type a message to some random people i don't know and just send it especially when its about a topic we are
all there to talk about in the first place but even with all of that it still felt like i had a rock in my chest every time i was typing out a message to send
it too about 5 different times before i was able to send my first message.

Now to my surprise it was actually welcomed and got a lot of positive response from what i send in the context to what they were talking about,
i ended up having a longer conversation with some of the people there and we started talking about creating things for the community and about some of
the things the people there wanted to have and agreed we would try and make something ourself and send it the next day.

The next day we all send what we had made for it and people ended up liking it so much some of the things got added to the main chanel as a emote
one of them being a emote i made and in return got the creator to talk directly to me to thank me which is something i never thought would happen.

That then inspired me to make more creative things and i have now ended up becoming known in the community for being a GIF/emote creator and have
gotten a few requests from the moderators of the chanel as well as the community itself

so from confronting a fear to becoming a known person in a online space... that wasn't really the thing i expected to get out of this whole project
but i can say without a doubt that its given me a lot of confidence and motivation to try and challenge my fear of speaking up and out to people, especially
with all the positive affirmation i have been receiving since then.

And i would lie if i said it doesn't feel amazing to see 10.000 people using a emote i made
so while i have been extremely overwhelmed with messages and people approaching me with ideas its also been a amazing 
learning experience!
