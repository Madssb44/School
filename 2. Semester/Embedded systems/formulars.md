## time
|Known values|Formula|explanation 
|Distance & Speed|$$Time = Distance / Speed$$|Distance divided by time results in the total time moved
|Time started & time ended|$$Total time used = Time started - time ended$$|by taking the starting time and minusing the ending time you get the total time used
