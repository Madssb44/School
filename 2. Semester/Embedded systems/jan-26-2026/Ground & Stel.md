# H-bridge, ground and stel 


## Stel 
when we are working with more than 50 V we need to have a stel which is a point where all ground is connected together 

we also need to have a seperate stel for analog and didigtal connections 

## Ground
when you refer to ground it means a point that doesnt communicate with anything and is usually set deep in the 'ground'

this is important because with stel we still have a constant voltage going through it meaning that there is still a chance
that you can short your circuit with it while ground has a way to compleatly discharge without causing the circuit any harm
