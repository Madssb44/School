## What is interupts 
What is a interupt in python

Interupt in python is then you have a seperate timer thats counting in the background while your tasks are running

This can be done in different ways the most common being with ticks

So by setting a tick counter and having a intival it updates in set by yourself (often 1 ms or smaller) 

Then you have a task manager that controlls the different tasks different tasks while keeping track of the tick counter 

Then when the task manager has a task thats done it will stop the currently running program and inserts the code that is set to go off then a task is done



## tasks 
What is a task? 

Something that runs over and over to accomplish something while a function is something thats meant to do something once to later be used

So a task for us right now would be something like running our car, listening over the wifi 

Then under running the car is the functions that makes it run 

## Combining it all
