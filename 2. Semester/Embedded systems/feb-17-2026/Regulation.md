# Rugulation using PI & PID
rugulation is when you try to take the human logic of how you would regulat something and turn it into a program 

P - stands for potenital and is a magic number you want to regulate after and is most often something that you will  
do some triles to find

you might want to make a offset that depends on what your outside paramaters are



I - stands for integral and is the number of times it has happened plotted out on a graph
