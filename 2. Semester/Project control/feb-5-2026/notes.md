# notes for today 

when defining requirements we dont take account for resourses used  

we do take account for the thing that needs to be in place before something else can be done 

some thing needs to be started and finished in one go while some things might be started and then returned to at a later point 

when making a plan on how long a task is gonna take is a educated guess so
