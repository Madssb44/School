# moduls in python

## what is a modul 

a modul is a folder you import into your code as to then be able to then call the functions form the modul you imported


Modules are structred to only have one functionality

while a modul only should cover one function there can be more functions in a modul fx 

sensors
    TOF_sensor.py 
    Reflection_sensor.py 

in this example sensors is the modul and you can then call the different sensors and the functions that are in them  


a main will always be the start and will then call other modules to get the entire program to work together 


## why use moduls in python 

it makes a codebase more readable espically when working in a large codebase 

## diagram structure 

the hiarcy is dicided by who starts the whole process 

and should go as close to each specific function
