# moduls in python

## what is a modul 

a modul is a file that you call for a function that isn't a part of your code 

Modules are structred to only have one functionality

a main will always be the start and will then call other modules to get the entire program to work together 


## why use moduls in python 

it makes a codebase more readable espically when working in a large codebase 

## diagram structure 

the hiarcy is dicided by who starts the whole process 

and should go as close to each specific function
