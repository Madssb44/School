# Notes for today
Recapping of IPO, modulstructure, flowcharts, classes, objects, init, attributes, methods, initilizing methods and arguments

talk about how to use AI and when to use it 


# Recap 

## Classes 

You allways have your __init__(self, att1, att2)

It is important that when you make a object with your class
you always need to give it the attributes you have difined in its __init__

You can still give it different attributes under the class like so 

def __init__(self, att1, att2)
    self.att1 = att1 
    self.att2 = att2 
    self.att3 = 0 
    self.att4 = "character"

Now all the instances made with the class will have the same att3 & att4 without having to define then when you build the object


# AI and how to use it
The general forcast is that most companies will be looking for people who know how to use AI efficently 

But knowing how to use it and how to use it well is 2 different things!

## AI as a tool 
Never use one by itself each AI has some things its good at and some things its not
so mix them and find out which is the best for what you need
