# Static routing over a WM 

## NAT 
network adress translation
it translates the requests from the vm so they all talk over the hosts ip address and the host handles where things should go

## Host Only
its only the host that can access the internet but the vm's can talk locally between eachother 


## Lan segments
you make a small segment of a local network which is only allowed to talk with a certain part of the network chosen by the segment settings

## Briged  
connects the network directly with your public ip address via your hosts dhcp making the vm's be their own divice without talking through the host pc
