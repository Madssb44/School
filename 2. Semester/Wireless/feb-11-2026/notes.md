# Notes for today

getting to know WMware workstation better and learn more about working with networksettings through it

linux routing and windows routing and working between them 

network software



Using network 

using ip addresses to have your own personal identity on the internet, and while you only have 1 public ip address
you can have lots of local ip addresses allowing you to have access to the internet form a lot of different divices

you also have different ports which allows you to access more than one thing
at a time by allowing you to asign a port to a certain task


Password security by allowing encryption of data via hashes and other encryption methods

Passwords are also encryption before leaving your local network meaning that
someone would need to already be on your network to
see your passwords or other information you are sending

you also have cookies which is a way for a website to remember who you are when you try to connect to them,
allowing you to not have the need to log in each time you enter a website.


by using a DNS you can communicate with other things on the internet without typing out their ip addresses
and bi using different URL parameters

some websites also have a session cookie which allows you to have your own version of the website
with changes made only to yours that could be something like a game played on a website, 
by having a session cookie you can have your own progress without having it
effect everyone else and their progress, then combining that with a user cookie will then allow you to even close
the website entirely and comming back at a later point and returning to where you are since you have a user cookie,
which can tell the site who you are and so they can look through their users
and then find your session cookie and return you to where you left off 


you can use the internet to send messages over the entire world,
without having to have a physical connection to the person you are trying to reach


it also allows for streaming of live video feeds all over the world as well as voice transmition as well as file sharing and much more
while having different ways to send the information depending on the level of safety you want for the information
as well as the speed you want to send something at 


since a package is comming to you through a router it is also possiable to keep a log of what is comming through your network
which can be used for different purposes depending on what you want to log form your network. 


Some of the most common uses for logging on a network would be:
    Security 
        by logging the network trafic you can look at which ip addresses have sent the information that might be malisious 

    Workload
        It is also a great tool for website owners to find out how much trafic they need to handle and when to expand their capasity

    Data collection
        theres plenty of useful data you can take from just a normal networklog such as where the trafic is comming from much more
        allowing a company to see what tho demographic is for their services
